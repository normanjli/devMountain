// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
*/
let planning = `determine what role the program needs to fill, what the needs are for the remainder of the development lifecycle, and how many resources to allocate for the program`
let analysis = `determine what functions are required for the program to fulfill the needs as determined in the planning step, determine what the minimun to market testing standards need to be`
let design = `design the overall framework and individual functions of the program`
let Implementation = `bringing the individual components which were made in the previous step and bring them together in one program`
let Testing = `testing the progrm following integration to ensure program has robust function and will work for most consumers`
let Maintain = `continuous maintanence of program to ensure robust function for novel use cases not discovered in the testing step or adding additional features as requested by consumer`
