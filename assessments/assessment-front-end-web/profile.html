<h1>About Norman</h1>
<section id="about">
    My name is Norman. I am a 25 year old male currently living in Salt Lake City, I was trying to make a living doing landfill gas work. However that is pretty tough on your body. I took the leap into a coding bootcamp and am enjoying each and every day of it.

        <h3>Previous Employment</h3>
        <p>I have held many different jobs over the years, the first of which was at an ice rink. I worked there doing anything and everytthing to help out. The next was a summer job as a lab assistant doing rapid prototyping. Thats where I got my first exposure to python programming. Then I held a job as a university grader. Then it was Air Quality monitoring. My favorite job I have held was probably my ski patrol days.</p>
